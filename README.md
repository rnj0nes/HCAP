# HCAP Factor Analysis Supplementary Files
This repo provides documentation and files related to data analysis for a factor analysis of the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) neuropsychological performance battery in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. This repo contains a PDF ([Jones-2020-Analysis-Supplement-HCAP-Factor-Analysis-20200427.pdf](https://github.com/rnj0nes/HCAP/blob/master/Jones-2020-Analysis-Supplement-HCAP-Factor-Analysis-20200427.pdf)) with 111 pages of source variables, their handling and distribution, and model summaries. Model summaries include a discussion of analysis decisions. All of the models presented in PsyArXiv preprint are described, plus a few additional models. In addition, we present the Mplus OUTput files for all of the models descrined in the PsyArXiv preprint.
