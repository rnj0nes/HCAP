# HCAP
Data handling and factor analysis of the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) neuropsychological performance battery in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. This repo contains a PDF ([Jones-2020-Analysis-Supplement-HCAP-Factor-Analysis-20200427.pdf](https://github.com/rnj0nes/HCAP/blob/master/Jones-2020-Analysis-Supplement-HCAP-Factor-Analysis-20200427.pdf)) with 111 pages of source variables, their handling and distribution, and model summaries. Model summaries include discussion of analysis decisions. All of the models presented in PsyArXiv preprint are described, plus a few additional models. In addition, we present the Mplus OUTput files for all of the models descrined in the PsyArXiv preprint (https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rvmhj).
